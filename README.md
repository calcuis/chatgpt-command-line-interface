### ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) command line prompt

***Obtain the pre-trained model (chat.gguf) file here: https://github.com/calcuis/chatgpt-ai-model/releases/tag/0.1

Pull the model file with the code together then simply run it by
```
python chat.py
```
### code review section
Let's break down the Python code step by step:
```
from llama_cpp import Llama
```
This line imports the Llama class from the llama_cpp module. It seems like this module provides a class named Llama that is being used in the code.
```
llm = Llama(model_path="chat.gguf")
```
An instance of the Llama class is created and assigned to the variable llm. The constructor of the Llama class is called with the argument model_path="chat.gguf", indicating the path to the model file or directory named "chat.gguf".
```
while True:
    ask = input("Enter a Question (Q for quit): ")
```
This initiates an infinite loop (while True:) where the user is prompted to enter a question. The input is stored in the variable ask. The loop will continue until the user enters "q" or "Q" to quit.
```
    if ask == "q" or ask == "Q":
        break
```
If the user input is "q" or "Q", the loop breaks, and the program proceeds to the next line.

```
    output = llm("Q: "+ask, max_tokens=2048, echo=True)
```
The llm instance (an object of the Llama class) is called with the input question appended with "Q: " (likely to indicate it's a question). The max_tokens parameter is set to 2048, indicating the maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. The echo parameter is set to True, which might indicate that the input question should be echoed in the output.

```
    answer = output['choices'][0]['text']
```
The generated response is extracted from the output. It seems like the response is stored in the variable answer. The response is obtained from the first choice in the list of choices in the output.
```
    print(answer)
```
The generated answer is printed to the console.
```
print("Goodbye!")
```
Once the user decides to quit the loop by entering "q" or "Q", the program prints "Goodbye!" and exits.

In summary, this code uses the Llama class from the llama_cpp module to interactively chat with a model loaded from the "chat.gguf" file. The user can input questions, and the program generates responses using the loaded model until the user decides to quit. The interaction is conducted within a simple command-line interface.
